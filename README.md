# SciBob
SciBob is a meta-builder and management tool for scientific software, it drives other tools such as EasyBuild, Spack, Conda and Mamba to build a single environment and integrates documentation from various sites.  

The first element of SciBob is aws-eb.py, an experimental yet functional tool to build recent EasyBuild software (EasyConfigs) on AWS. [Please see details here](https://github.com/dirkpetersen/dptests/tree/main/aws-eb)
